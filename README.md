Cordova Config Properties
=========================

Not all properties displayed on the Phonegap website are actually usable. Some are only usable if your use PhoneGap build. The purpose of this repo is to keep a list of all found properties that are actually being used by scanning the Cordova's source code.

One notable property that exists for PhoneGap build but not for CLI is the Orientation property.

There are also some properties that are undocumented entirely.

Check out the cordovaConfig.xml file for the current standing list of properties that are usable.
